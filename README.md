# SOS-Turkish-game-
SOS is a Turkish 2-player game similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, with the goal being spelling SOS across a square board of customizable size, with one player being S and the other being O. Once an SOS is spelled, the player who put down the last letter gets a point. One letter can only be used to spell SOS only once across the board. 

The goal of this project is to recreate it to be playable on a computer with two players on one computer initially and later on different devices with two different accounts.

If possible, a "vs AI" option will be added in the future.
